# am205_compiled_lang
Code examples for the compiled language workshop for AM205, Fall 2020

If you are using commandline, one way to compile the code is to use a C++ compiler such as GNU GCC/G++.
Installing the compiler would depend on your computer.
Check out installation guides of the compiler you choose to use. If you need help, email us.

For example, on a Mac or Linux with GNU GCC/G++ installed, open terminal and navigate to this repo folder.
Type into the terminal:

g++ -o test c_style_array.cc

would compile c_style_array.cc into an executable called "test".

Run the executable by

./test

The other way to use these codes is to use an online compiler, such as

onlinegdb.com

Select the language to be C++ on the top right corner of the web-based compiler.
Simply copy and paste the codes into the text box on the page, and hit run to see the output in the console below.
Note that the online compiler can be much slower in compiling and producing output. This is a limit imposed by the online compiler, but not an issue with compilers and compiled languages in general.
